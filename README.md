# Dooble Topic

My doodle is about tetris, I want to animate the pieces falling into place, and then each letter is a link to information or they clear and a version of tetris starts, If Im unable to make multiple pages ill instead have the words flash and clear (like how it would if you cleared a line in the game) and then start coding the pieces for tetris  / make a version of the game.
